Tensorflow for rasberry pi 4 docker container

I wanted to try out tesnor flow. So I upgrade the OS to the latest as it was quite old. It was then I found tensorflow was not support but was in teh previous.

pain but hey Ill just compile. 
Right lets get it down 
Ahhh I need Bazel just get that 
ok Need to compile it 
right get the source
compile foir what ever reason this crashes the PI I need a terminal on it :/ as nothing in the logs. I suspect my 4yo throwing it around the house might have damaged it.

So where to go at this point I would advice anyone to get a cloud server and just work from there. 

Cross compile well apart from the millions my work have I dont really have computers these days. 

Any long story short found docker container on the correct distor and python version to support tensorflow and then created my own container.

Here is the Dockerfile do as you wish I will remove at some point
